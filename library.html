                    <p> There was once a kingdom hidden within the far reaches of space, a space kingdom if you will. It sat against the nothingness of the void, twinkling like a brilliant gem. The leader of this kingdom was a wise and powerful man, who ruled over it with kindness. With the help of his cosmic powers the kingdom's subjects knew only peace and prosperity. The walls of the kingdom vault were lined with treasures and relics each more valuable and awe-inspiring than the last. However, each of these items would pale in comparison to the King's most beloved treasure, his daughter.</p>

                    <p>She was the final gift his late wife had given him before she joined the stars shining in the night sky. * was her name, and she was practically joined at her father's hip. The two would spend their days playing make believe and throwing tea parties for only the most royal of plushies. As * grew so did her love for the stories she would hear from members of the castle. Whether it was the story of "The upside down desert" from the royal cartographer or "How wishing wells catch stars" from the royal seamstress, * was enamored. These sparks of interest would soon ignite into a blazing passion for story making. She would spend countless nights writing new stories to act out with her father, much to the castle's amusement. She was especially proud of "The Palace Wrapped in Stars", a short story about a young girl who lived in a grand castle adrift in space.</p>
                        
                    <p>As she grew, so did her writing. However, the writing never strayed far from the storybook-like tales she was told in her youth. The King was delighted to watch his daughter come into her own, but he was getting on in years and even the brightest star will eventually fade. He feared the heartache his daughter would face when she no longer had his companionship to keep her company. In an effort to keep this heartache at bay he devised what would eventually be his final act as King. He asked his daughter for her childhood notebook. The notebook was filled with writings of whimsical worlds, cartoonish creatures, and adventure as far as the eye could see. Using what power he had left, he breathed life into the notebook. Just as the King's eyes began to dim, a new light in the night sky began to shine out. On the outermost edge of the kingdom's reach a new galaxy was forming. Within it a gentle star radiated love to its new orbiting bodies. While this was the end for the Palace Wrapped in Stars, it was only the beginning for a new story, in the Sayonara System. </p>
